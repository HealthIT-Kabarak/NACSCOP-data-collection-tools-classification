A model that advices on the indicator based on historical data values, facility characteristics, changes in the indicator, etc in making a choice on the indicator to use

NACSCOP Data Collection Tools - Indicator Selection Model
Welcome to the NACSCOP Data Collection Tools - Indicator Selection Model! This project aims to provide an objective approach to select the appropriate indicator for data collection and reporting, during the transition period of two sets of tools being in use.

The objective of this project is to develop a classification model that advises on the indicator to use, devoid of human bias, based on historical data values, facility characteristics, changes in the indicator, and other pertinent factors.

With this model, NACSCOP will be able to make informed decisions on what indicator to use, ensuring accurate and consistent data collection and reporting. The model will help NACSCOP select the most appropriate indicator for each facility, based on the unique characteristics of each facility, and changes in the data over time.

Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need to clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies. The code is written in Python, using various libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.

The repository contains the following files:

demo.py - this is the main file containing the code for the classification model.
model.pkl- the packaged model i a pckle file
two documentations
README.md - this file contains information about the project, including how to get started.
Running the Model
To run the model, simply open the model.py file and run it in your Python environment. The model will take in the data from data.csv and use it to train the classifier. The output of the model will be the recommended indicator to use for each facility.

Contributing
We welcome contributions to this project! If you would like to contribute, please fork the repository and make your changes. Once you have made your changes, submit a pull request, and we will review your changes.

Conclusion
The NACSCOP Data Collection Tools - Indicator Selection Model is an important project that will help ensure accurate and consistent data collection and reporting during the transition period. We are excited to work on this project, and we hope it will be a valuable tool for NACSCOP and other organizations.
