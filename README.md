  A model that advices on the indicator based on historical data values, facility characteristics, changes in the indicator, etc in making a choice on     the indicator to use

## 1.2 NACSCOP Data Collection Tools - Indicator Selection Model:

  Welcome to the NACSCOP Data Collection Tools - Indicator Selection Model! This project aims to provide an objective approach to select the appropriate   indicator for data collection and reporting, during the transition period of two sets of tools being in use.

## 1.3 The objective of this project is to develop a classification model:

Advises on the indicator to use, devoid of human bias, based on historical data values, facility characteristics, changes in the indicator, and other pertinent factors.

## 1.4 With this model:

NACSCOP will be able to make informed decisions on what indicator to use, ensuring accurate and consistent data collection and reporting. The model will help NACSCOP select the most appropriate indicator for each facility, based on the unique characteristics of each facility, and changes in the data over time.
